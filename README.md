# Self Test Suite for Rpi Pico

This is a self test program designed to excercise as many parts of the MicroZig RP2XXX HAL as possible. It uses the Raspberry Pi Pico, along with some additional passives/ICs to accomplish this.

Please see the schematic of the test jig at [doc/rp2040_test_jig.pdf](doc/rp2040_test_jig.pdf).

Note that the [Adafruit MSA301 Module](https://learn.adafruit.com/msa301-triple-axis-accelerometer) was used for I2C testing. The relevant datasheet for that component can be found at [doc/MSA301-V1.0-ENG.PDF](doc/MSA301-V1.0-ENG.PDF).
